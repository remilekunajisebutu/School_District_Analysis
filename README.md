# School_District_Analysis
## Overview
Performing an analysis using school and student data to inform a school district on their budget and priorities.


## Results
The school district discovered that the standardized test scores for ninth grade students at Thomas High School were incorrect, and they requested for updated data summaries. After further discussion, it was best to only replace the ninth grade math and reading scores at Thomas High School while keeping all other data associated with this student group intact.

Both math and reading scores were replaced with "NaN", which represents a "Not-a-Number" value, for 461 student records. Although this may seem like a significant number, these score replacements did not alter data summaries tremendously overall.

When assessing school summaries and performing schools, the score replacements did affect the ranking of the top five performing schools. Thomas High School ranked second place in the top five performing schools with a 91% overall passing. After replacing both math and reading scores, Thomas High School was taken out of the top five category since they now display a 65% overall passing. On the plus side, these changes did not place Thomas High School among the bottom five performing schools. Those ranks remained the same. Per the revised School Summary, Thomas High School now ranks 8th place among 15 high schools in the district.

Another plus side from this data replacement is that it did not change the math and reading scores by grade. Granted, both the average math and reading score summaries were stratisfied by school and grade level. As shown above, the summary tables display "NaN" for ninth grade at Thomas High School whereas the remaining data remained intact.
